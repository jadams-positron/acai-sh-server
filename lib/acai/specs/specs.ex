  Lists all active implementations in a product that have a valid canonical spec for the given feature.

  Uses a batched query approach to avoid N+1 patterns:
  1. Fetches all active implementations for the product
  2. Preloads all product implementations to build ancestry chains
  3. Batch fetches tracked branches for all implementations and ancestors
  4. Batch fetches specs for those branches (scoped to product)
  5. Filters implementations that can resolve the feature

  Lists all active implementations in a product that have a valid canonical spec for the given feature.

  An implementation is considered "valid" for a feature if `resolve_canonical_spec/3` returns
  a spec for that (feature_name, implementation_id) pair. This includes:
  - Implementations with the spec on their tracked branches
  - Implementations that inherit the spec from a parent implementation

  Only active implementations (is_active: true) are returned.

  Returns a list of Implementation structs that can be used in dropdown selectors.

  Resolves the canonical spec for a feature_name and implementation.

  The resolution follows this order:
  1. Search for specs on the implementation's tracked branches (by branch_id)
     that also belong to the implementation's product
  2. If not found, recurse up the parent_implementation_id chain,
     but only consider specs that belong to the original implementation's product

  Returns {spec, source_info} where source_info is a map containing:
  - :is_inherited - boolean indicating if spec came from parent chain
  - :source_implementation_id - the implementation ID where spec was found (or nil if local)
  - :source_branch - the branch where spec was found (or nil)

  Returns {nil, nil} if no spec found anywhere in the ancestry, or if the only
  matching spec belongs to a different product than the implementation.
